Some comments...

* Packages would have been divided into use cases if was more complex.
* Some field names would have been changed to more explanatory ones if it wasn't for mapping 
reasons and lack of time.
* @RepositoryRestResource could have been an alternative approach but makes things to simple to 
showcase any code.
* Spring Data JPA specifications in controller could have been another approach, however, it breaks with hexagonal 
architecture as it makes your architecture JPA dependant. It's a sacrifice that your need to take with knowledge.
* Query by example would've been ok.
* And rsql parser could have been another possibility.
